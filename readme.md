Track my progress writting Python code to solve small coding challenges from time to time. It helps keep my coding brain and arms sharp. Most importantly, I really enjoy it.

It's a tiny project but has been setup some of the essential to ensure code quality.
- Pre-commit hooks, to lint and format code.
- CI build script, to run unit tests.
- Integrate with Coveralls for test suite's coverage.
- No CD pipeline configured so far since no package and release requirement.
