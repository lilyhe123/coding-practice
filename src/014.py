question 14
The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal
places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x2 + y2 = r2.
-------------------

Monte Carlo Simulation is a type of computational algorithm that
uses repeated random sampling to obtain the likelihood of
a range of results of occurring.
