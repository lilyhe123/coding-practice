"""
question 83
Invert a binary tree.

For example, given the following tree:

   a
  / \
 b   c
/ \\ /
d e  f

should become:

  a
 /  \
c    b
\\  /  \
 f  e   d

-------------------

For every node its left and right child needs to be swapped.
This needs to be done to every node in the tree.
We can do this in recursive way (DFS) or interative way (BFS)
