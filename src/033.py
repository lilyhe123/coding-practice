question 33
Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers.
That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list
so far on each new element.
Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of
the two middle numbers.
input: [2, 1,   5, 7,   2, 0, 5]
output:[2, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 2, 2, 2]
-------------------

1. Understand the problem

Input is a stream of numbers, output is print the median of the list
so far on each new element.
any constrains?
numbers are in the stream, so it's can be very huge number
2. brainstorm
