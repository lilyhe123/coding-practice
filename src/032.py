question 32 TODO
This problem was asked by Jane Street.
Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates,
represented as a 2D array.
Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether
there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount
A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount
greater than A of that currency.

There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.

Recall algorithms that are used to detect specific types of cycles in
graphs based on edge weights. Two algorithms that are often useful for
problems involving weighted paths and cycles come to mind.
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm: This algorithm can detect negative cycles.
  If, after V-1 iterations (where V is the number of vertices),
  we can still relax an edge, it means there is a negative cycle in the graph.
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: This algorithm can find the shortest paths
  between all pairs of vertices. We can check the diagonal elements of the
  resulting distance matrix. If any diagonal element is negative, it indicates
  a negative cycle starting and ending at that vertex.
